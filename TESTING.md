### Python Validation
The Python code was checked using the pep8 validator available at pep8online.com. Errors were reported for to longer lines i edited my code accordingly until there were no reported errors by the validator. The following file however did include warnings regarding a line break before binary operator this is acceptable due to some code needing to be on more than one line.

list of files with warnings
run.py - 4 warnings

The point in the PEP8 guidelines can be found [here](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/)

Start Menu Functionality
The start menu input was tested for the correct validation of the user input. On correct input the screen will redirect to the correct screen. On incorrect input the input validation correctly displays an error message to the user to provide guidance on how to move on.
